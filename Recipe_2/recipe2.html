    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.
        </li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle cornmeal on a pizza peel or the back of a baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to the prepared peel or baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Add your favorite pizza toppings on top of the cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Drizzle a little olive oil over the toppings.
        </li>
        <li>Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone in the oven, if using, or place the baking sheet directly in the oven.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.
        </li>
